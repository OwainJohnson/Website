	<h2>Fighting coronavirus</h2>
	<p>As restrictions ease here in the UK – infections are soaring for millions of the world’s poorest people – with no proper vaccination programmes in sight. Oxfam is working with partners in India and other countries to help people protect themselves and supply essential medical equipment to hospitals that are struggling to cope under the immense strain.</p>

<div class="Div-two">
	<h3>Climate Change</h3>
	<p2>Right now, climate change is hitting the poorest people on the planet the hardest. Every day poverty is made worse by the devastating effects of extreme weather. So every day, together with volunteers and local partners, we support people around the world to prepare, adapt and respond.</p2>
